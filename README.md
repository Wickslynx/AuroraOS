Placeholder

# Getting Started:

**1.** Build the OS:
$ git clone https://github.com/Wickslynx/AuroraOS
$ cd AuroraOS
$ make img


**2.** Run the OS with QEMU:
$ qemu-system-i386 -drive -format=raw, auroraos.iso #will be updated i forgot the command :sob:

**Building on real hardware...**
So you are building AuroraOS on real hardware, I wouldn't recommend it but here is how.
$ make iso
Burn the auroraos.iso onto a bootable USB, this might work or not.. Good luck!
