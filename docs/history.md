## The History of AuroraOS
<br>

# **Late 2024 - November, December..**
This was the start to AuroraOS, i had never done any OS developing, and just used AI to make a simple bootloader which displayed "Booting AuroraOS".. This bootloader/kernel was scrapped pretty fast.
<br>


# **A few months later...**
Over christmas AuroraOS was really on-hold, I just abandoned it as it was "too hard".
After a few months I started working again, i had just seen a video about Tetris OS, and took heavy inspiration from it. There i had it, a blue screen!
