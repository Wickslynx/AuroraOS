## The History of AuroraOS
<br>

# **Late 2024 - November, December..**
This was the start to AuroraOS, i had never done any OS developing, and just used AI to make a simple bootloader which displayed "Booting AuroraOS".. This bootloader/kernel was scrapped pretty fast.
<br>


# **A few months later...**
Over christmas AuroraOS was really on-hold, I just abandoned it as it was "too hard".
After a few months I started working again, i had just seen a video about Tetris OS, and took heavy inspiration from it. There i had it, a blue screen!

I started experimenting with font rendering (taken from Tetris OS) and other stuff, here's an other

# **Better UI system..**
I started with other UI elements, like windows, a terminal and other stuff. Didn't really make any meaningfull progress.

# **Processes, filesystem, new build system..**
So, for the next month I just worked on actually meaningfull stuff. Even though it didn't really show on the outside.

# **Image rendering.. (Current state)**
Just some days ago i finnaly rendered my first image, even though it was not really planned and not so usefull, i was bored of the backend stuff.
