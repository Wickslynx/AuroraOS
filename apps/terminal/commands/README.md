This is the directory that will store all of the source code files of all commands.

The commands will be nothing more than our own versions of UNIX/Linux commands like
cd, ls, mkdir, cat, etc etc. We will take heavy inspiration of the original commands
of UNIX/Linux and adjust them to conform with the core structure and functionality 
of AuroraOS. All rigths reserved.
